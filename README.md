> Important: ðŸ’»  This exercise is interactive. Please follow the instructions.

Most developers today are required not only to write code, but also need to write code to test their own code ðŸ˜±, yes... really.

Today we are going to be using the [jest framework](https://jestjs.io/) to create our first test.

This was an interactive exercise using learnpack i've added an app.js and test.js javascripts that include the additional 2 conversions needed.
